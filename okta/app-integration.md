## üîç Quick Overview: SAML and OIDC

When integrating applications with Okta, two common protocols are used to enable Single Sign-On (SSO): **SAML** and **OIDC**.

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** is an XML-based standard widely used for enterprise web applications. It allows Okta to securely share authentication information with apps so users can sign in once and access multiple services without re-entering credentials.

- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** is a modern, REST/JSON-based protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0. It‚Äôs commonly used for mobile and web applications and provides both authentication and user profile information through secure tokens.

Both protocols help improve security and user experience by allowing seamless access to multiple applications after a single Okta login.

## üí° Note on Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning

JIT provisioning allows Okta to automatically create or update user accounts in the target application the moment a user signs in for the first time. This reduces administrative overhead by avoiding manual account creation and helps ensure users always have timely access.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set It Up

1. **Add a New App in Okta**
   - Navigate to the Okta Admin Console
   - Go to **Applications** ‚Üí **Applications** ‚Üí click *Create App Integration*.
   - Choose the appropriate sign-in method:
     - **SAML 2.0** for enterprise web apps.
     - **OIDC** - Web Application for modern or public-facing apps.
   - Provide basic info (App name, logo, etc.)

  

3. **Configure SAML / OIDC Settings**
   - Fill in SSO URL, Entity ID, Attributes
   - (Use a test app like *GitHub* or *dummyapp.io* if desired)

3. **Assign the App to a Test User**

---

5. **Test SSO Flow**

üì∏ Screenshots:
- App created and assigned  
- SAML assertion response  
- Logged in successfully to app

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
- SSO should successfully authenticate assigned users into the app  
- Users should not be prompted for credentials after Okta login  
- Okta logs each authentication event in the **System Log**
