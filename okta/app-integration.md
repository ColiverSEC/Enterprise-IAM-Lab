## 🔍 Quick Overview: SAML and OIDC

When integrating applications with Okta, two common protocols are used to enable Single Sign-On (SSO): **SAML** and **OIDC**.

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** is an XML-based standard widely used for enterprise web applications. It allows Okta to securely share authentication information with apps so users can sign in once and access multiple services without re-entering credentials.

- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** is a modern, REST/JSON-based protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0. It’s commonly used for mobile and web applications and provides both authentication and user profile information through secure tokens.

Both protocols help improve security and user experience by allowing seamless access to multiple applications after a single Okta login.

---

## 💡 Note on Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning

JIT provisioning allows Okta to automatically create or update user accounts in the target application the moment a user signs in for the first time. This reduces administrative overhead by avoiding manual account creation and helps ensure users always have timely access.

---

## 🛠️ How to Set It Up: SAML

1. **Add a New App in Okta**
- Navigate to the Okta Admin Console
- Go to **Applications** → **Applications** → click *Create App Integration*.
- Choose the appropriate sign-in method:
  - **SAML 2.0** for enterprise web apps.
- Click **Next**, then provide:
  - A name for your app (e.g., “GitHub SSO Test”).
  - Optionally, upload an app logo for easier identification.
- Click **Next** to proceed to the configuration screen.

---
  
2. **Configure SAML Settings**
- **For SAML 2.0:**
- Input required fields:
  - **Single Sign-On URL (SSO URL)** – where Okta will send the authentication response.
  - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** – unique identifier for the app.
  - **Default RelayState** - It tells Okta where to redirect users after successful SSO login. leave it blank or put / if you want to redirect to your site’s root URL.
  - **Name ID Format** - This defines how the user’s identifier is sent in the SAML assertion. For most apps, the default or *EmailAddress* format works best.
  - **Application Username** - This determines which Okta user profile attribute is sent as the NameID. Typically, use *Email* here.
  - **Update Application Username on** - This controls when Okta updates the username in the SAML assertion after the user profile changes.
> - **📒 Optional:** Enable JIT Provisioning by including required attributes (like email) and ensuring the app supports it

3. **Assign the App to a Test User**
- Go to **Assignments** → click **Assign** → choose **Assign to People** or **Groups**.
- Select a test user (or group), confirm the user details, and click **Save and Go Back** → **Done**.
  - This ensures the user has access and can initiate the login flow.

---

4. **Test the SSO Flow**
- Open a new browser/incognito window.
- Log in as the assigned test user.
- Access the app directly or through the **Okta Dashboard**.
  - Confirm:
    - You’re redirected to the app without re-authenticating.
    - User profile attributes are passed correctly (check via developer tools or app-side logs).
    - You can use browser dev tools or SAML-tracer (which was used for this lab) to inspect the SAML assertion.

## 🎯 Results

- The assigned user can seamlessly authenticate via Okta SSO, with attributes passed correctly and accounts auto-provisioned if JIT is enabled.

---

## 🛠️ How to Set It Up: OIDC

1. **Add a New App in Okta**
- Navigate to the Okta Admin Console
- Go to **Applications** → **Applications** → click *Create App Integration*.
- Choose : **OIDC** - Web Application for modern or public-facing apps. 
  - select **App Type**:
    - **Web Application**: For server-side apps that can keep a client secret secure (e.g., traditional web servers).
    - **Single Page Application (SPA)**: JavaScript apps running in browsers that cannot securely keep a client secret.
    - **Native Application**: Mobile or desktop apps installed on a device 
- Click **Next** to proceed to the configuration screen.

2. **Configure OIDC Settings**
- Fill in the following:
  - A name for your app (e.g., “GitHub SSO Test”).
  - Optionally, upload an app logo for easier identification.
  - **Sign-in redirect URIs**: This is where Okta sends users after login.
  - **Sign-out redirect URIs**: (Optional) Where users are sent after logout.
  - **Trusted Origins:** (Optional but recommended) Add your domain to Trusted Origins for CORS support.

---

4. **Grab Credentials**
- After saving, Okta generates a Client ID and Client Secret.
- Go to **Applications** → **Applications** → click *Your Created App* → **General**
- You’ll then see your credentials and You’ll use these in your app to request tokens.

5. **Set Up Your Application to Use OIDC**
> ‼️Important‼️
> 
> Your app needs to:
>  - Redirect users to Okta’s authorization endpoint.
>  - Handle the callback on the redirect URI.
>  - Exchange the authorization code for tokens using client ID/secret.
>  - Validate tokens and extract user info.
>> 🔑 What was used:
>> - **Used Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the code editor and terminal for running the app locally.[Link to install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
>> - Installed **Python 3.13** (or used embedded Python) on Windows. [Link to download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
>> - Installed required Python packages using **pip**:
>> ``` pip install flask authlib python-dotenv ```
>> - Create a working folder (e.g., `C:\Users\a-doliver\PythonOIDCApp`)
- After installing the necessary tools, you will need to create a python script in Visual Studio Code (VSC):
  - While in VSC → click **Open Folder** and navigate to the target folder → right click in the **Explorer** tab → create **New File** named *app.py*
  - In the *app_py* file paste the following → **Save**:
    
```
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, session
from authlib.integrations.flask_client import OAuth
import os
import secrets  # for nonce generation

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'random_secret_key'  # Replace with something secure in production

oauth = OAuth(app)

# Configure Okta OIDC client
okta = oauth.register(
    name='okta',
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    server_metadata_url='https://trial-9842597.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration',
    client_kwargs={
        'scope': 'openid profile email',
    }
)

@app.route('/')
def homepage():
    user = dict(session).get('user')
    if user:
        return f"<h1>Welcome {user['name']}</h1><p>Email: {user['email']}</p><a href='/logout'>Logout</a>"
    return '<a href="/login">Login with Okta</a>'

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    # Generate nonce and store in session
    nonce = secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
    session['nonce'] = nonce

    redirect_uri = url_for('auth', _external=True)
    return okta.authorize_redirect(redirect_uri, nonce=nonce)

@app.route('/authorization-code/callback')
def auth():
    token = okta.authorize_access_token()
    nonce = session.get('nonce')
    user_info = okta.parse_id_token(token, nonce=nonce)

    session['user'] = user_info
    return redirect('/')

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.clear()
    return redirect('/')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=8080, debug=True)
```
📌 Replace These Placeholders:
- `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` → Your client ID from the Okta app settings  
- `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` → Your client secret from the Okta app  
- `https://trial-9842597.okta.com` → Your Okta domain (if different)

7. **Test It**
- Open your browser and go to: ``` http://localhost:8080 ```
- Click **Login with Okta**.
- You will be redirected to your Okta trial login screen.
- Sign in with a test user (create users in the Okta admin panel if needed).
- After successful login, you'll be redirected back to your app.
- The app will display the user's name and email.
💡 Tip: If the page doesn’t load after login, check your redirect URI in Okta and ensure it matches `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback`

📸 **Screenshots**:

![Successful Sign In](screenshots/app-integration/oidc-successful-login.png)

## 🎯 Results

- The test user can log in through Okta OIDC, with tokens successfully received and user info displayed by the app, confirming correct integration and optional JIT provisioning.

---

## ⚡ Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning

Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning allows Okta to create or update user accounts in an external application the first time a user signs in via SSO. This eliminates the need to pre-provision users manually in the app and ensures access is granted instantly, using attributes passed in the SAML or OIDC assertion.

---

### 🔐 JIT with SAML

1. **Configure Attribute Statements in Okta**  
   - In your SAML app integration settings, scroll down to **Attribute Statements (Optional)**.  
   - Add the user attributes your service provider (SP) requires to auto-create accounts:

   | Name       | Name Format | Value          |
   |------------|-------------|----------------|
   | `email`    | Unspecified | `user.email`   |
   | `firstName`| Unspecified | `user.firstName`|
   | `lastName` | Unspecified | `user.lastName`|

   ![SAML JIT Attributes](screenshots/app-integration/saml-jit-attribute-statements.png)

2. **Enable JIT in the Application**  
   - In the service provider’s admin console, enable JIT provisioning or user auto-creation.  
   - Ensure attribute names match what Okta sends.

3. **Test JIT Provisioning**  
   - Create a new user in Okta not previously provisioned in the app.  
   - Assign the app to that user.  
   - Sign in as the user; the app should auto-create the account based on attributes sent by Okta.

---

### 🔓 JIT with OIDC

1. **Add User Claims in Okta**  
   - In your OIDC app integration, go to **Sign-On** → click **Edit**.  
   - Under **Attribute Statements (Claims)**, add required claims, commonly:

   | Claim Name    | Value           |
   |--------------|-----------------|
   | `email`       | `user.email`    |
   | `given_name`  | `user.firstName`|
   | `family_name` | `user.lastName` |

   ![OIDC Claims](screenshots/app-integration/oidc-claims-setup.png)

2. **Ensure JIT Support in the Application**  
   - Verify the client app or API supports JIT provisioning using claims from the ID token or userinfo endpoint.  
   - Map claims like `email`, `given_name`, and `family_name` to user creation logic.

3. **Test OIDC-Based JIT**  
   - Create and assign a new user in Okta.  
   - Initiate login via OIDC in the app.  
   - On first login, the app should auto-create the user account using data from the token or userinfo response.
