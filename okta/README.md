# 🔐 Okta IAM Lab

[⬅️ Back to Enterprise IAM Lab Overview](../README.md)

This lab provides **hands-on experience** with **Okta Identity Cloud**, a leading identity provider (IdP) for cloud and enterprise apps. It focuses on:

- ✅ Application integrations using SAML & OIDC
- ✅ Single Sign-On (SSO) and Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning
- ✅ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enforcement with custom policies
- ✅ User lifecycle automation with Okta Workflows

These walkthroughs mirror **enterprise IAM engineer tasks** for securing access and automating identity processes.
