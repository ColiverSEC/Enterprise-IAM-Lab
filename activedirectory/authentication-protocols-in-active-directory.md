# 🛡️ Authentication Protocols in Active Directory

⬅️ [Back to Active Directory (On-Prem) Lab Overview](./README.md)

This walkthrough focuses on understanding and configuring authentication protocols in Windows Server Active Directory. You’ll learn how AD handles authentication with Kerberos, NTLM, and LDAP/LDAPS, and how to configure, test, and secure these protocols in a lab environment.

---

## 📚 What This Lab Covers

- Overview of authentication protocols in AD: Kerberos, NTLM, LDAP/LDAPS
- Configuring AD to use and enforce specific protocols
- Testing authentication from client machines
- Securing authentication traffic with LDAPS
- Understanding ticketing, delegation, and protocol flow
- Auditing and troubleshooting authentication

---

## 📝 What You’ll Need

🔹 Windows Server 2019 (or later) with AD DS installed

🔹 Windows 10/11 client (domain-joined)

🔹 Active Directory domain set up (e.g., `corp.lab`)

🔹 PowerShell (on DC or client with RSAT)

🔹 Optional: Wireshark for packet capture / protocol analysis

## 📖 Understanding AD Authentication Protocols (Concepts)

- **Kerberos**: Default authentication protocol in AD, uses tickets (TGT and Service Tickets)
- **NTLM**: Legacy protocol for backward compatibility; uses challenge/response hash
- **LDAP / LDAPS**: Directory access protocol; LDAPS encrypts traffic with SSL/TLS
- AD authentication is controlled by **policies, group membership, and SPNs**
> 💡 *Tip: Use klist to view Kerberos tickets on a client or nltest /sc_query:corp to test domain secure channel.*

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Relying on NTLM**: Only use if necessary; vulnerable to pass-the-hash attacks
- **Unencrypted LDAP**: Always prefer LDAPS for applications and services
- **Time synchronization issues**: Kerberos requires synchronized clocks (within 5 min by default)
- **SPN misconfiguration**: Can cause Kerberos authentication failures

---

## 🔧 Configure and Test Kerberos Authentication

### Step 1: Verify Kerberos Tickets
- Open PowerShell or Command Prompt on a client
- **Run**: `klist`
- You should see a TGT for your logged-in user

### Step 2: Force Kerberos Authentication to a Service

- Connect to a network service using a domain account (e.g., file share)
- Use PowerShell to validate ticket usage:
 - **Run**: `klist tgt`

---

## 🔧 Configure and Test NTLM Authentication

### Step 3: Enable NTLM for a Specific Server (Optional)

- Open **Group Policy Management** → Domain Controllers Policy
- Navigate to **Computer Configuration** → **Policies** → **Windows Settings** → **Security Settings** → **Local Policies** → **Security Options**
- Check settings like **Network security: LAN Manager authentication level**

### Step 4: Test NTLM Login

- Use a legacy SMB share or remote desktop connection
- Optionally capture authentication with Wireshark to view NTLM handshake

## 🔧 Configure LDAP / LDAPS Authentication

### Step 5: Enable LDAPS

- Import a valid SSL certificate to the Domain Controller
- Restart AD DS service to enable LDAPS

### Step 6: Test LDAP/LDAPS Connection

- From a client, **run**:
```# LDAP (unencrypted)
Get-ADUser -Identity username

# LDAPS (encrypted)
Get-ADUser -Identity username -Server "ldaps://corp.lab:636"
```

## 🔍 Verify and Audit Authentication

### Step 7: Check Event Logs

- Open **Event Viewer** → **Windows Logs** → **Security**
- Look for event IDs:
  - 4768: Kerberos TGT requested
  - 4769: Service ticket requested
  - 4624: Successful logon

### Step 8: Troubleshoot Failures

- Use `klist purge` to clear tickets
- Use `nltest /sc_verify:corp` to verify secure channel
- Check clock sync, SPNs, and user permissions

---

## 🔄 Real-World Scenario Example

**Scenario**: An application must authenticate to AD using Kerberos and failover to LDAPS if necessary.
- Verify client tickets using `klist`
- Test LDAPS connection using PowerShell
- Confirm NTLM fallback only occurs when necessary

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

- Kerberos is used by default for domain logons
- LDAPS secures application authentication
- NTLM is only used when legacy systems require it
- All authentication events are logged in Security Event Log for auditing

---

## 🔄 Optional Enhancements

- Configure constrained Kerberos delegation for specific services
- Capture and analyze authentication packets using Wireshark
- Enforce stronger NTLM policies or disable NTLM entirely
