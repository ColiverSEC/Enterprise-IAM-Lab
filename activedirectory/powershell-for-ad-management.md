# üíª PowerShell for AD Management

‚¨ÖÔ∏è [Back to Active Directory (On-Prem) Lab Overview](./README.md)

This walkthrough focuses on automating routine Active Directory (AD) management tasks using PowerShell. You‚Äôll learn how to use common AD cmdlets and scripts to manage users, groups, and organizational units efficiently, saving time and reducing manual errors.

---

## üìö What This Lab Covers

- Introduction to the Active Directory module for PowerShell
- Querying AD objects (users, groups, OUs)
- Creating, modifying, and removing AD objects
- Managing group membership
- Bulk operations with CSV or TXT files
- PowerShell best practices for AD management
- Verifying changes using both PowerShell and GUI tools

---

## üìù What You‚Äôll Need

üîπ Windows Server 2019 (or later) with AD DS installed

üîπ Windows 10/11 client (domain-joined) with RSAT tools installed

üîπ Active Directory domain set up (e.g., corp.lab)

üîπ PowerShell (5.1+ or PowerShell 7) with ActiveDirectory module
> üí° *Tip: Run Import-Module ActiveDirectory to ensure the module is loaded before starting*

## üìñ Understanding PowerShell for AD Management (Concepts)

- **AD Module Cmdlets**: PowerShell provides cmdlets like Get-ADUser, New-ADUser, Set-ADUser, and Remove-ADUser for AD object management
- **Automation**: Tasks like bulk user creation, group membership updates, and OU queries can be fully automated
- **Scripting vs GUI**: Scripts reduce human error, ensure consistency, and allow repeatable processes
- **Permissions:** You must have sufficient AD permissions to perform these operations; running as a delegated admin or domain admin is common in labs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Wrong scope**: Modifying the wrong OU or group can create problems,always verify the path
- **Forgetting replication**: Changes in AD might take time to replicate; verify across DCs if needed
- **Syntax errors**: PowerShell is case-insensitive but strict about cmdlet parameters. Use Get-Help <cmdlet> to confirm usage\
- **Bulk operations without testing**: Always test scripts with a small subset before applying domain-wide changes

## üë§ Querying AD Objects

**Step 1: Get Users**
```
# Get all users in the domain
Get-ADUser -Filter * 

# Get a specific user
Get-ADUser -Identity jdoe -Properties DisplayName, EmailAddress
```

### Step 2: Get Groups and Membership

```# Get all groups
Get-ADGroup -Filter *

# Get members of a specific group
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "HRAdmins"
```
- **Identity**: Specifies the target group

üì∏ **Screenshot**: PowerShell ‚Äì Get-ADGroupMember

## üîß Creating and Modifying AD Objects

### Step 3: Create a New User

```
New-ADUser -Name "John Doe" -GivenName "John" -Surname "Doe" `
-DisplayName "John Doe" -SamAccountName "jdoe" `
-UserPrincipalName "jdoe@corp.lab" -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd!" -AsPlainText -Force) `
-Enabled $true -Path "OU=Sales,DC=corp,DC=lab"
```
**Explanation of Parameters:**
- **Name**: Full name of the account
- **GivenName** / Surname: First and last names
- **DisplayName**: Name displayed in AD and email address book
- **SamAccountName**: Legacy logon name
- **UserPrincipalName**: Modern logon format (email-style)
- **AccountPassword**: Initial password (secure string)
- **Enabled**: Account status (True = active)
- **Path**: Target OU in AD

### Step 4: Modify User Attributes
```
Set-ADUser -Identity jdoe -Title "Sales Representative" -Department "Sales"
```
- **Identity**: Specifies the user to modify
- **Title / -Department**: Updates job-related attributes

### Step 5: Remove a User

```
Remove-ADUser -Identity jdoe
```
- **Identity**: Specifies the user to delete

## üë• Managing Groups

### Step 6: Add or Remove Users from a Group

```
# Add user to group
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "SalesAdmins" -Members jdoe

# Remove user from group
Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity "SalesAdmins" -Members jdoe -Confirm:$false
```
- **Identity**: Target group
- **Members**: User(s) to add/remove
- **Confirm:$false**: Suppresses confirmation prompts
-

## üìä Bulk Operations with CSV or TXT Files

### Step 7: Create Multiple Users
```
# CSV format: FirstName,LastName,SamAccountName,OU
Import-Csv "C:\Temp\NewUsers.csv" | ForEach-Object {
    New-ADUser -Name "$($_.FirstName) $($_.LastName)" `
    -GivenName $_.FirstName -Surname $_.LastName `
    -SamAccountName $_.SamAccountName -UserPrincipalName "$($_.SamAccountName)@corp.lab" `
    -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd!" -AsPlainText -Force) `
    -Enabled $true -Path $_.OU
}
```
---

## üîÑ Verify Changes

### Step 8: Confirm User Creation
```
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=Sales,DC=corp,DC=lab" | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName
```
- **SearchBase:** Limits search to specific OU
- **Select-Object:** Displays only chosen properties

## üß© Optional: Automate Reporting
- Export AD users to a CSV for auditing or reporting:
```
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties DisplayName, EmailAddress, Department | 
Select-Object DisplayName, EmailAddress, Department | 
Export-Csv "C:\Temp\ADUsersReport.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
- Exports user data to CSV for auditing or reporting

---

## üîÑ Real-World Scenario Example

**Scenario**: A new sales cohort joins the company

- Bulk-create 20 new users in `OU=Sales,DC=corp,DC=lab` from a CSV
- Assign them to `SalesAdmins` group
- Verify creation and group membership

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

- Users and groups can be created, modified, or removed via PowerShell
- Bulk operations work with CSV input for efficiency
- Changes reflect immediately in AD (replication may delay for multi-DC environments)
- Auditing scripts provide verification and reporting

--- 

## üîÑ Optional Enhancements
- Schedule PowerShell scripts via Task Scheduler for routine automation
- Combine with logging to maintain an audit trail
- Integrate with Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC) for hybrid GUI/script workflows
- Use TXT-based scripts for large-scale bulk user creation
