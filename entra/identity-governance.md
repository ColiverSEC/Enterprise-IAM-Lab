## 🔁 Configure Access Reviews

### Step 1: Create an Access Review

- Go to **Identity Governance → Access Reviews → + New access review**  
- Select **target group or application** → **Next**
- Select reviewers:
  - Could be the user’s manager, the user themselves (self-review), or specific admins
- Set **review frequency** (one-time or recurring) → **Next**
- Configure Additional settings:
  - Decide what happens if reviewers don’t respond (e.g., keep, remove, or take no action on access)
  - Choose what to do when users are denied — typically remove access automatically
  - Enable or disable options like **Justification required** and **Email notifications** for reviewers
- Once configured, click **Review + Create** 
- Name your review:
  - e.g., `Finance Project Access Review`
- Click **Create** to finalize your access review
- Run review and take action on results (approve/revoke access)

📸 **Screenshot Example:**  
![Access Review Type](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/06-review-type.png)
![Access Review Settings](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/07-review-settings.png)

![Access Review and Create](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/09-access-review-and-create.png)

### Step 2: Approve or Deny Access Review

- Go to [**My Access portal**](https://myaccess.microsoft.com) and sign in
- Select **Access reviews** from the left menu
- Open the access review assigned to you as a reviewer
- For each user listed:  
  - Click **Approve** to keep their access  
  - Click **Deny** to remove their access  
  - Optionally, provide a justification if required  
- Submit your decisions (The system will apply changes once the review completes)

## 🔐 Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) — Microsoft Entra Roles

> Goal: delegate privileged roles as **eligible** assignments (just-in-time elevation) with approval, MFA, and time limits.

### Step 1: Open PIM
- Go to **Microsoft Entra Admin Center → Identity Governance → Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**
- Choose **Microsoft Entra roles**

### Step 2: Review PIM sections (overview)
- Use the left pane: **Overview, Roles, Assignments, Alerts, Access reviews, Discovery & insights**
- In the main area you may see quick actions: **Assign, Activate, Approve, Audit** — these are the common actions PIM supports

📸 **Screenshot Example:** 
![PIM Menu](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/11-pim-menu.png)

### Step 3: Add a role assignment (use **Assign**)
- Click **Roles** → find the built-in role you want to delegate (e.g., **User Administrator**, **Groups Administrator**, **Global Administrator**)
- Click the role → click **Add assignment** (or **Assign**) in the role blade
- Choose **Select assignment type**:
  - **Eligible** — recommended: user must **activate** the role when needed (JIT)
  - **Active** — user gets the role immediately (full time). Use sparingly
- Choose the **member(s)** (user or group) to assign
- Set **Assignment settings**:
  - **Start / End date** (time-bound recommended)
  - **Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)** on activation
  - **Require approval to activate** (toggle on if you want approvers to review requests)
  - **Require justification** (user must enter a reason when activating)
  - **Ticketing or requestable reason** (optional: link an ITSM ticket number)
- Configure **Approvers** if approval is required (user, group, or role)
- Click **Assign** to create the eligible/active assignment

📸 **Screenshot Example:** 
![User set to eligable](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/12-user-set-to-eligable.png)
![Assignment Settings](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/13-default-assignment-settings.png)


### Step 4: Test activation (user flow)
- As the assigned user, go to **Entra Admin Portal**
- Go to **Identity Governance** → **Privileged Identity Management** → **My roles** 
- Select the role and click **Activate**
- Provide **justification**, complete **MFA**, and (if configured) wait for **approval**
- After activation, the user has the role for the configured duration

📸 **Screenshot Example:** 
![PIM Activation Test](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/17-pim-activation-test.png)
![PIM Role Activated](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/18-pim-role-activated-test.png)


### Step 5: Configure periodic governance
- **Access reviews**:
  - Create an access review for the role to periodically validate assignments
  - **Entra → Identity Governance → Microsoft Entra roles → Access reviews → New →** target the role or the AU/group
- **Alerts & Notifications**:
  - Enable PIM alerts (risky activations, expired assignments, etc.)
- **Audit / Review logs**:
  - Use **Audit** or **Activity logs** to track assignments/activations/approvals

📸 **Screenshot Example:** 
![PIM Access Review](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/19-pim-access-review-user-admin.png)

### Step 6: Discovery & Insights (optional)
- Run **Discovery** to find privileged accounts and roles in your tenant — useful before large PIM rollouts

## 🆘 Create Break-Glass (Emergency) Administrator Accounts

> 💡 **Purpose:**  
> Emergency access accounts (also called “break-glass” accounts) provide a secure way to regain administrative access to your tenant if normal accounts are locked out due to MFA, Conditional Access, or outages.

### Step 1: Create a Dedicated Global Administrator Account

  - Go to **Microsoft Entra ID → Users → + New user**  
  - **Name:**
    - `BreakGlassAdmin01`  
  - **Username:**
    - `breakglassadmin01@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com`  
  - Assign the **Global Administrator** role  

### Step 2: Set a Strong, Long-Lived Password

   - Use a complex, unique password that doesn’t expire automatically  
   - Store the password securely (e.g., in a sealed envelope or offline password vault)

### Step 3: Exclude from Conditional Access Policies 

   - Navigate to **Entra → Protection → Conditional Access → Policies**  
   - Edit each policy enforcing MFA or access restrictions  
   - Under **Assignments → Exclude → Users and groups**, add the break-glass account  

### Step 4: (Optional) Configure Monitoring  

   - Enable **sign-in log alerts** for the account using **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Defender for Cloud Apps**, or **Log Analytics**  
   - Alert the security team whenever a break-glass account signs in  

### Step 5: Store Credentials Securely Offline

   - Keep the credentials in a secure physical location (e.g., safe or locked cabinet)  
   - Document access procedures and authorization rules

## 📊 Monitor and Report

> 💡 **Purpose:**  
> Monitoring ensures that access is being requested, approved, and revoked correctly. It also helps detect unusual activity or misconfigurations in your Identity Governance setup.

### Step 1: Monitor Access Packages  

   - Go to **Entra Admin Center → Identity Governance → Entitlement management → Access packages → Requests**  
   - Review pending, approved, and rejected requests  

### Step 2: Review Access Reviews  

   - Navigate to **Entra Admin Center → Identity Governance → Access reviews**  
   - Check completed and ongoing reviews for compliance and anomalies  
   - Note which users were removed or retained

📸 **Screenshot Example:**  
![On going Access Reviews](/entra/screenshots/09-identity-governance/10-access-review-results.png)

### Step 3: Audit PIM Activities 

   - Go to **Entra Admin Center → Identity Governance → Privileged Identity Management → My Audit history**  
   - Monitor role activations, approvals, and expirations  

### Step 4: Activity Logs Overview

   - Navigate to **Identity Governance → Entitlement management → Reports**  
   - Filter by date, user, or application to analyze trends and verify proper access management

> 💡 **Tip:** Schedule regular reviews of these logs to ensure governance policies are followed and to detect any unusual activity early.
