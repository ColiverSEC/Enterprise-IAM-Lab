# 🔐 Microsoft Entra ID Lab

[⬅️ Back to Enterprise IAM Lab Overview](../README.md)

This lab provides hands-on experience with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), a modern cloud-based identity and access management platform. It covers the full spectrum of enterprise IAM tasks, including identity management, authentication, application access, governance, and monitoring.

Key focus areas include:

✅ Tenant configuration, roles, and delegation

✅ User and group provisioning (manual, bulk, PowerShell, dynamic groups)

✅ External identities (B2B/B2C) and guest lifecycle management

✅ Hybrid identity with Azure AD Connect (PHS/PTA, SSO, password writeback, monitoring)

✅ Authentication methods, MFA, Windows Hello, and self-service password reset

✅ Conditional Access policies with device compliance and session management

✅ Identity Protection and risk-based policies (user & sign-in risk)

✅ Azure resource access and RBAC, managed identities, and Key Vault security

✅ Enterprise application integrations, app registrations, and SCIM provisioning

✅ Identity Governance (access packages, PIM, access reviews, emergency accounts)

✅ Monitoring, reporting, and integration with Microsoft Sentinel and Entra Workbooks

✅ Global Secure Access for Internet and Private Access, and network-level Conditional Access

These walkthroughs simulate real-world IAM engineering tasks, preparing you to design, implement, and manage a secure, scalable, and governed identity environment across cloud and hybrid infrastructures.
