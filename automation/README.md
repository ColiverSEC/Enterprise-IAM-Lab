# 🤖 Automation Module

[⬅️ Back to Enterprise IAM Lab Overview](../README.md)

This module provides **hands-on experience with cross-platform IAM automation**.  
Instead of focusing on a single platform (like Entra, Okta, or AD), this lab demonstrates how automation can **orchestrate identity lifecycle tasks across multiple systems**.  

Key focus areas include:  

- ✅ Cross-platform provisioning & deprovisioning  
- ✅ Joiner / Mover / Leaver lifecycle automation  
- ✅ Compliance reporting & certifications  
- ✅ Self-service & helpdesk automation  
- ✅ Orchestration across AD, Entra ID, and Okta  
- ✅ Logging, error handling, and governance for automation
